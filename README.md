TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

!["first page"](https://github.com/spiritxhx/tinyapp/blob/master/img/urls.png)
Users will go to this page by default, users can log in and register before they can create or have access to the shortURLs. 

!["page after login"](https://github.com/spiritxhx/tinyapp/blob/master/img/login.png)
After logged in or registered, users can see the list of urls created by them, they can also edit or delete the urls. 

!["edit page with visit count"](https://github.com/spiritxhx/tinyapp/blob/master/img/editWithCount.png)
In the edit page, users can edit the longURL of the shortURL, and users can see the visit times of the shortURLs. 

!["log in with no shortURLs"](https://github.com/spiritxhx/tinyapp/blob/master/img/editWithCount.png)
When users logged in with no shortURLs on their own, the app will ask user to create a new shortURL.
